An example model run for a 2009 discrete (moulin) runoff input is given, which produces model output as plotted in Figure 5. Run file is nevis_22222.m. All model code located within "nevis" directory.

To run the model for additional years (2008, 2010), for a distributed runoff input (distributed, discrete), or for other parameter values, edit the nevis_22222.m file where indicated. 

Additional information on the nevis model is given in nevis.pdf (written by Ian Hewitt).
